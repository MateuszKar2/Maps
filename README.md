# Maps

**Maps** is a web application that allows users to view and interact with maps. It integrates with a map API (such as Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) to provide users with functionality like searching locations, displaying markers, and exploring geographic information.

The application is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, providing an easy way for users to interact with maps and find locations based on their needs.

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 View interactive maps.
- 🔍 Search for locations by name or coordinates.
- 📍 Mark specific locations on the map with custom markers.
- 📱 Fully responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
- 🌐 Integrates with popular map APIs (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) or [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) - For rendering interactive maps.
- [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - React wrapper for Leaflet (if you're using Leaflet).
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For making HTTP requests to the map API (if needed).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MateuszKar2/Maps.git
   cd Maps
2.**Install dependencies:**

npm install

3/**Add API keys (if necessary):**

If you're using a map API such as Google Maps, you will need to add your API key. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following (replace your_api_key with your actual API key):

REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
For OpenStreetMap, you may not need an API key.

4.**Run the application:**

npm start

5.**The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.**
